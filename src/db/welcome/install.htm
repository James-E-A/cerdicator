<title>Welcome!</title>
<h1>Welcome!</h1>

You've just installed <tt>cerdicator</tt>!

<h2>Quick Setup</h2>

<p>If you haven't done so already, <strong>take a moment to do the following</strong>:</p>

<p>If you see a <strong>gap</strong> on the top-left of your browser, between the URL bar and the Home, Reload, and Forward/Back buttons</p>

<ol style="line-height: 1.5em;">
<li>Right-click it and hit <code>Customize</code></li>
<li>Click and drag that spacer down from where it was, into the big tray of items below it</li>
<li>Click and drag <tt>cerdicatorðŸ§¿</tt> into its place: <img src="exLoc.png" style="vertical-align: middle" /></li>
</ol>

<p>This will improve your view of the indicator, and place it logically near the browser's TLS indicator.</p>

<hr />

<h2>How To Use</h2>

<p>When you're visiting a website, the indicator will show the image of the company that's (sort of) ultimately responsibile for making sure your connection is secure from hackers.</p>

<p>You'll also see a little "Badge" in the <strong>top-right</strong> corner of the icon, with some <strong>quick info</strong> about the connection:</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">

<li>
<h3>NEON Green <small>(with a fox face)</small>: <img src="mozilla.png" /></h3>
Your connection is approved by a company that <strong>Mozilla specifically trusts</strong>! Everything is probably OK!
</li>

<li>
<h3>DULL Teal <small>(with a letter)</small>:  <img src="alt.png" /></h3>
Your connection is approved by an <strong>alternative trust root</strong>. For now, there's only two: CAcert, and the U.S. Federal Common Policy CA.
</li>

<li>
<h3>NUCLEAR Magenta/Fucshia: <img src="mitm.png" /></h3>
Your connection is <strong>currently being monitored.</strong><br />
It's probably your employer, and </em>probably not</em> a hacker.<br />
If you see this on your personal laptop, and don't know why, <em>something is wrong</em> and you should see someone tech-y right away.
</li>

<li>
<h3>BRIGHT Cyan: <img src="unknown.png" /></h3>
If you ever see this, something <em>very interesting</em> is happening, and I would be <em>thrilled</em> if you'd <a href="mailto:james@ishygddt.xyz">follow up with me</a> for some more details. It would help the project a lot.
</li>

<li>
<h3>Grey: <img src="unsec.png" /></h3>
Your connection is currently not secured.
</li>

</ul>
