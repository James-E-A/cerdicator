You've just installed or updated ``cerdicator`` to version 0.0.7!

If you haven't done so already, take a moment to do the following:

1. If you see a **gap** on the top-left of your browser, between the URL bar and the Home, Reload, and Forward/Back buttons, right-click it and hit ``Customize``
2. Click and drag that spacer down from where it was, into the big tray of items below it
3. Click and ``cerdicator``\ ðŸ§¿ into its place
4. You're done! (This add-on will become more useful eventually...)

If you're a coder and would like to lend a hand, please check out the `open Issues on GitHub <https://github.com/JamesTheAwesomeDude/cerdicator/issues>`_!

I look forward to completing this and adding some more features. Feel free to suggest things you want at the Issues link above.
