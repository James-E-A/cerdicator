Welcome!
========

You've just installed or updated ``cerdicator`` to version 0.0.8!

Quick Setup
-----------

If you haven't done so already, take a moment to do the following:

1. If you see a **gap** on the top-left of your browser, between the URL bar and the Home, Reload, and Forward/Back buttons, right-click it and hit ``Customize``
2. Click and drag that spacer down from where it was, into the big tray of items below it
3. Click and drag ``cerdicator``\ ðŸ§¿ into its place

This will improve your view of the indicator, and place it logically near the browser's TLS indicator.

How To Use
----------

When you're visiting a website, the indicator will show the image of the company that's (sort of) ultimately responsibile for making sure your connection is secure from hackers.

You'll also see a little "Badge" in the **top-right** corner of the icon, with some **quick info** about the connection:

NEON Green
``````````
(with a fox face):

Your connection is approved by a company that **Mozilla specifically trusts**! Everything is probably OK!

DULL Teal
`````````
(with a letter):

Your connection is approved by an **alternative trust root**. For now, there's only one: CAcert. It's a pretty trustworthy company, and is the only reputable company currently securing OpenNIC's "altnet". Congratulations on being in the club.

NUCLEAR Magenta/Fucshia:
````````````````````````
Your connection is **currently being monitored.**

It's probably your employer, and *probably not* a hacker.  

If you see this on your personal laptop, and don't know why, *something is wrong* and you should see someone tech-y right away.

BRIGHT Cyan:
````````````
If you ever see this, something *very interesting* is happening, and I would be *thrilled* if you'd follow up with me for some more details. It would help the project a lot.

Grey:
`````
Your connection is currently not secured.
